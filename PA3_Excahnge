c. Write an assembly language program to exchange the block of data bytes
present in internal memory
Mov r0,#30h
Mov r1,#40h
Mov r2,#5
 Loop : mov a,@r0
xch a,@r1 //exchange the contents of A and 40h
mov @r0,a
inc r0
inc r1
djnz r2,loop
end

d. Program to exchange the contents of two external memory locations.
Mov dptr,#9000h //initialize dptr with the external address 9000h
Movx a,@dptr //copy the data from the external address to A
Mov r0,a
Inc dptr
Movx a,@dptr
Xch a,r0
Movx @dptr,a
Dec 82h
Mov a,r0
Movx @dptr,a
 Loop : sjmp
